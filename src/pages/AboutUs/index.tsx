            The team has been working diligently to create an exceptional new
            home community in Napanee with the pending release of Springside
            Meadows. This is not a singular development for the group within
            Napanee, they have over 300 acres of development land and are making
            a long-term commitment to the Napanee Area. It was an easy
            commitment for the company to make given everything Napanee offers
            and its proximity to so much within a 30 km radius in either
            direction.
