              The team has been working diligently to create an exceptional new
              home community in Napanee with the pending release of Springside
              Meadows. This is not a singular development for the group within
              Napanee, they have over 300 acres of development land and are
              making a long-term commitment to the Napanee Area. It was an easy
              commitment for the company to make given everything Napanee offers
              and its proximity to so much within a 30 km radius in either
              direction.
